Comparison of robustness for various methods of computing confidence intervals for means


My task was to find a way to compute exact robustness of several methods of computing confidence intervals for means and compare them by confidence level and types of distributions with visualization, implementation in R (under supervision of dr hab. in≈º. Zbigniew Szkutnik)
